13:31 Don?
13:32 Hey, Dr. Saram, how are you?
13:33 Great, how are you?
13:34 I'm good.
13:35 What's new?
13:37 Not a whole lot. How have you been?
13:39 I'm doing okay. Yeah, good.
13:41 Thank you.
13:42 Yeah. Uh, we're following up on your PSAs and whatnot.
13:46 Yeah.
13:47 Uh, in November, this last PSA was 0.18.
13:51 Right.
13:51 To 0.13, 0.15. So it's been in that range.
13:56 Yeah.
13:56 It's hanging just above 0.1, but not moving quickly. So, um, you know, the question is how significant is that.
14:07 You're now many years out, uh, seven years out, eight years out from surgery.
14:12 Yeah.
14:13 And the ultra-sensitive PSA is a funky test because it measures the PSA at one decimal point more or or or or.
14:24 And the definition of a PSA failure or whatever is 0.1, 0.2. So you're still in that range.
14:31 I see.
14:32 And you're by no means, you know, in an area where we're concerned about it.
14:37 Right, right. Last time I think you told me 2.0 is when you start to get it, take, get your attention.
14:43 Yeah, I think... So, I'm I'm good with just doing nothing right now.
15:06 Okay.
15:06 Okay?
15:07 Okay.
15:10 So the last time we we talked about, you know, every four months, should I continue every four months?
15:14 Six months.
15:15 Six months. Okay, good. And then if there's a significant change, then we talk about a PET scan and stuff. But a PET scan is not going to show anything at this stage yet.
15:23 Okay. So, okay.
15:26 And so really it's you're you're looking at the rate of change more than anything?
15:32 Yes.
15:32 Okay.
15:33 If there's rapid rise and if the value goes up significantly, then we do a PET scan.
15:39 Okay.
15:40 And uh and then, you know, if there's signals outside the prostate and there's concerns about things, then we talk about radiation, hormones, whatever it is, but we don't need that now.
15:48 Okay, good. And because we've been checking the ultra-sensitive PSA, we'll check it again because we want to compare apples to apples.
15:55 Okay.
15:56 But but in general, one can argue that we shouldn't even check an ultra-sensitive PSA. We could just check a regular PSA.
16:03 Oh, I didn't realize there was there was a difference.
16:05 Yeah, there's two different things, yeah. Sometimes, you know, I always check just a regular PSA, but then if somebody checks an ultra-sensitive PSA, then we get obligated to follow that test. So...
16:15 I see. Got it. So that was the one that I had had from um uh, you know, either Kubasko or MedNow.
16:24 Yeah. So are you still going to see Dr. Merk?
16:26 Yeah.
16:27 Good. Okay.
16:28 So far so good, huh? He hasn't quit.
16:32 Yeah, he hasn't quit. That's a good sign.
16:35 Um, I'm due to go back and see him. They they I walked downstairs and got some lab orders from him, but of course, being a doctor and a bad patient, it's been weeks and I haven't done my labs yet. So...
16:45 Of course not.
16:46 I'm supposed to go have my labs drawn and go back and see him, but he's done a pretty, he's...
16:51 I liked him.
16:51 Yeah.
16:52 I liked him. You know, it's a tough bar, you know. Bill was uh, you know, really good.
16:58 So, um my wife actually went to somebody else, and not cuz she she hadn't met him, but she just thought, she felt he was going to be, he was too young for her. And uh, you know, she she was a critical care nurse and, you know, she wanted somebody. So, um so the guy she's got, she's not that happy with. She's over at um, uh, um, what whatchamacallit, um, is it uh, UC Health?
17:18 Yeah.
17:18 UC Health.
17:19 In in Cherry Creek over there.
17:21 UC Health. My wife is a UC Health patient for various reasons and, man, they rake the system over a coal with the bills and stuff. And you know, she goes in and does a lab and then they charge her facility fee. She gets four different bills. And I'm like, you know, you should just go to the private world, it's less expensive and you have some different service. But I don't know, UC Health is weird.
17:44 Yeah.
17:45 Uh, UC Health is weird.
17:49 So far so good. I, you know, I also judge a practice by their operations, you know.
17:54 And so far they've been good. I mean they send me reminders, I can, you know, get in to see him. So...
17:58 Yeah. Yeah, right.
17:59 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean I I've only seen him once, and that you know, was this early summer.
18:06 And so I'll go again in the, you know, in the spring.
18:09 Yeah.
18:10 And uh, but yeah, and I I send him these, you know.
18:12 Yeah.
18:13 So, uh, he should know what's going on.
18:14 Yeah.
18:15 But yeah, I liked him. He seems like a smart guy.
18:18 He's a smart guy.
18:18 Yeah.
18:19 He's got a good, did he tell you his story?
18:21 He did. Yeah, he uh, spent some time on oil rigs making a bunch of money. So he has no debt.
18:27 Yeah.
18:27 Yeah, which is very smart.
18:29 Yeah. I think he's a he's a smart guy.
18:31 Yeah.
18:32 Yeah. And honestly, I mean these kids nowadays who go into graduate schools and they do it on loans, they'll never pay that off.
18:42 It is such a it is such a problem.
18:45 It's like a it's like a weight around your neck. Yeah.
18:47 It really is. And so he did it right.
18:50 Yeah. Cool.
18:51 Anyhow, I'll see you then.
18:52 Okay, so you'll uh, so I should make an appointment for six months.
18:55 Yeah.
18:55 And I and these are great.
18:58 And she'll give me an order for the test and all that.
18:59 Okay, okay.
19:00 Great. Okay. Thank you.
19:02 Yep, good seeing you.
19:03 Same here. Take care of yourself.
19:04 Yep, likewise.
19:05 This this way and out.
19:07 Okay.
19:08 Take care.
19:08 Take care.
19:15 You check out?
19:16 Yes.
19:20 Follow up in six months with a PSA?
19:21 Yes.
19:22 No problem. We can do that.
19:25 I'm glad you can.
19:26 [laughing]
