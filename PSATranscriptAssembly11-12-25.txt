I am Don Buckner and I'm at Dr. Saram's office. Hi, Dr. Saram. How are you? Great. How are you? Good. What's new? Not a whole lot. How about yourself? I'm doing okay. Yeah, good. Thank you. Yeah. We're following up on, you know, PSAs and whatnot. In November, this last PSA was 0.18. 0.13, 0.15. So it's been in that range. It's hanging just above 0.1, but not moving quickly. So, you know, the question is how significant is that? You're now many years out, seven years out, eight years out from surgery. And the ultra sensitive PSA is a funky test because it measures the PSA one decimal point more or and the definition of a PSA failure or whatever is 0.1 0.2 so you're still in that range I see and you're by no means you know in an area where we're concerned about right right last. Time I think you told me 2.0 is when you start to get it take get your attention yeah Yeah. So. I'm good with just doing nothing right now. Okay. Okay. Okay. So the last time we talked about, you know, every four months, should I continue every four months, six months? Okay, good. Okay. And then if there's a significant change, then we talk about a PET scan and stuff. But a PET scan is not going to show anything at this stage. Okay. Okay. And so really, you're looking at the rate of change more than anything? Yes. Okay. If there's rapid rise and if the value goes up significantly, then we do a PET scan. Okay. And then, you know, if there's signals outside the prostate and there's concerns about things, then we talk about radiation, hormones, whatever it is. Okay. Yeah. And because we've been checking the ultra sensitive PSA, we'll check it again because we want to compare apples to apples. Okay. But in general, one can argue that we shouldn't check an ultra sensitive PSA, we can just check a regular PSA. Oh, I didn't realize there was a difference. There's two different things. Sometimes, you know, I always check just a regular PSA, but then if somebody checks an ultra sensitive PSA, then we get obligated to follow that test. I see. Got it. So that was the one that I had had from you know, either Kubaska or Mednow or Merck. So are you still going to see Dr. Merck? Yeah. Good. Okay. So far so good, huh? Yeah. He hasn't quit. Yeah, he hasn't quit. That's a good sign. I'm due to go back and see him. I walked downstairs and got some lab orders from him, but of course being a doctor and a bad patient, it's been weeks and I haven't done my labs yet. Of course not. I'm supposed to go out my lab and go back and see him, but he's done a pretty, I like him. Yeah, I like him. You know, it's a tough bar, you know, Bill was, you know, really good. So, my wife actually went to somebody else, and not because she hadn't met him, but she felt he was too young for her. And, you know, she was a critical care nurse, and, you know, she wanted somebody. So, the guy she's got, she's not that happy. She's over at, what's it called? Is it UC Health? UC Health. In Cherry Creek over there. UC Health. My wife is a UC Health patient. And man, they rake the system over a call with the bills and stuff. And you know, she goes and does a lab and then they charge a facility fee. She gets four different bills. And I'm like, you know, you should just go to the private world. It's less expensive and it's different service. But I don't know, UC Health is weird. Yeah. UC Health is weird. So far so good. I also judge a practice by their operations, you know? So far they've been good. I mean, they. Yeah. Miners. Yeah. Right. I can, you know, get in to see them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've only seen them once, and that, you know, this is early summer. Yeah. And so I'll go again in, you know, in the spring. Yeah. And. But, yeah. And I sent him these, you know? Yeah. So he should know what's going on. But, yeah, I liked him. He seems like a smart guy. He's a smart guy. Yeah. He's got a good. Did he tell you the story? He did. Yeah. He spent some time on oil rigs, making a bunch of money, so he has no. Yeah. Yeah. Which is very smart. I think he's a, he's a smart guy. Yeah. And honestly, I mean, these kids nowadays who go into graduate schools and they do it on loans, they'll never pay that off. It's like a, it's like a weight around your neck. Yeah. It really is. And so he did it right. Yeah. Cool. I'll see you. Okay. So you'll, so I should make an appointment for six months. Yeah. And, and these are, oh, good. And she'll give me an order for the test and all that. Okay, great. Okay, thank you. Yep, good seeing you. Same here, take care of yourself. Yep, likewise. It's this way and out. Okay. Take care. Take care. Can we check out? Yes. Follow up in six months with a PSA, no problem. We can do that. I'm glad you can.
