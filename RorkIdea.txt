I was thinking, was use the n8n workflow as a prototype for building an mvp with no storage capability. Just using assembly ai api  for transcription, open ai for the analysis and Gamma api to create and send the result.

That's a smart de-scope. You're essentially building a mobile front-end for the n8n workflow logic, proving the core value proposition ("record → summarize → deliver") before tackling the longitudinal storage complexity.

**MVP Architecture (Rork-Generated):**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Mobile App (Rork + Expo)                               │
│  ├── Record audio (expo-av)                             │
│  ├── Upload file (expo-document-picker)                 │
│  ├── Input: appointment date, provider, email           │
│  └── Processing status UI                               │

```

**Critical Decision: Backend Proxy**

You can't ship API keys (AssemblyAI, OpenAI, Gamma) directly in a mobile app—they'd be trivially extractable. Three options:

| Option | Effort | Cost | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|------|----------------|
| **Keep n8n as backend** | Zero | Your existing instance | ✅ Best for MVP—expose a webhook endpoint that accepts audio + metadata, runs your existing workflow |
| **Supabase Edge Functions** | Medium | Free tier sufficient | Good if you want to decouple from n8n |
| **Vercel Serverless** | Medium | Free tier | Alternative to Supabase |

**The n8n-as-Backend Play:**

Your existing workflow already does everything. Modify it slightly:

1. Replace Google Drive Trigger with a **Webhook Trigger** that accepts:
   - Audio file (base64 or multipart)
   - `appointmentDate`, `providerName`, `specialty`, `recipientEmail`

2. Mobile app POSTs to that webhook, polls for completion (or you add a callback URL)

3. Email delivery already works

This way, Rork only needs to generate the UI layer—recording, file picker, form inputs, status display. The complex orchestration stays in n8n where it's already working.

**Rork Prompt Strategy:**

```
Build a medical appointment recording app with these screens:

1. HOME SCREEN
- "Record New Appointment" button (prominent)
- "Upload Existing Recording" button
- Simple branding header

2. RECORDING SCREEN  
- Large circular record button with pulse animation
- Live waveform visualization during recording
- Timer showing recording duration
- Stop button that transitions to Review screen

3. APPOINTMENT DETAILS SCREEN (after recording/upload)
- Date picker (appointment date, not today)
- Provider name text input
- Specialty dropdown (Urology, Cardiology, Primary Care, etc.)
- Email input for PDF delivery
- "Process Recording" submit button

4. PROCESSING STATUS SCREEN
- Step indicators: Uploading → Transcribing → Analyzing → Generating PDF → Sending
- Progress bar or spinner for current step
- Estimated time remaining
- "Processing complete! Check your email" success state

5. ERROR/RETRY SCREEN
- Friendly error message
- Retry button
- Contact support option

Use Expo, React Native, clean medical/healthcare aesthetic 
(blues, whites, subtle greens), accessible fonts.
```

**What You'll Need to Hand-Finish:**

1. **API integration layer** → Point to your n8n webhook
2. **Audio upload logic** → Convert recording to base64 or use multipart form
3. **Polling mechanism** → Check n8n for completion status (or implement webhooks back to app)
4. **The healthcare prompt** → Already exists in your n8n workflow, no changes needed

**Timeline Estimate:**

| Phase | Task | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| 1 | Rork generates UI scaffold | 2-4 hours |
| 2 | Modify n8n: add webhook trigger, parameterize email | 2-3 hours |
| 3 | Connect Rork app to n8n webhook | 3-4 hours |
| 4 | Testing + polish | 4-6 hours |
| **Total** | **Working MVP** | **~2 days** |

**Kismet:** The "no storage" MVP constraint actually mirrors how the original Shazam worked—it had no library, no history, just "listen → identify → display." Users loved the instant gratification so much that Shazam deliberately delayed adding history features because they feared it would complicate the magic. Your "record → PDF in email" flow has that same atomic simplicity. The storage/longitudinal features can come after you've validated that patients actually *use* the core loop.
